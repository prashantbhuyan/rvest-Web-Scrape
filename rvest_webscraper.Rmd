In this application I am using rvest to scrape the bloomberg.com website.  The information that I'm extracting contains the prices of market indices from around the world.  

I've extracted from a table embedded within the bloomberg website the Index Name, Value, Change, Open, High, Low and Time.  The results are printed below.

```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop")
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("hadley/rvest")
library(rvest)

markets <- html("http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/")

tables <- html_nodes(markets, "table")
markets.df <- data.frame(html_table(tables[[2]]))
colnames(markets.df) <- c("Index", "Value", "Change", "Open", "High", "Low", "Time")

markets.df

```
